What is Two Pointer Technique?
The two-pointer technique is an algorithmic approach that uses two indices, or pointers, to traverse a data structure like an array, string, or linked list. It is used to solve problems efficiently, 
often by moving the pointers toward each other or in the same direction.
Pointer = just an index (like i and j),
They can move:
        - from left to right
        - from right to left
        - from opposite ends
        - or move independently
❓ Why use Two Pointers?
Because it reduces time complexity from O(n²) (nested loops) → O(n) (single pass).
🏆 Where is Two Pointer Used?
(A) Sorting-based Problems : Use two pointers when array is sorted (or can be sorted)
   problem like,
           - Find pair with sum = target (Two Sum)
           - Find triplets (3Sum, 4Sum)
           - Remove duplicates in sorted array
           - Binary search–like problems
(B) Searching from both sides :
like,
    - Reverse an array
    - Palindrome check
    - Segregating 0s and 1s
    - Sort colors (0,1,2 – Dutch National Flag)
(C) Sliding Window (a type of two pointer) :
like,
    - Max/Min subarray sum
    - Longest substring without repeating
    - Fixed window problems
    - Variable window problems
(D) Partitioning or grouping :
like,
    - Partition array around pivot (QuickSort)
    - Move all negatives left and positives right
    - Move all even numbers left, odd right
