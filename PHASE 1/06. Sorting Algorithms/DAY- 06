6. Radix Sort :
Radix Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit instead of comparing whole numbers. It processes numbers from least significant digit (LSD) to most significant digit (MSD)
(or sometimes MSD to LSD, depending on implementation).
Radix Sort sorts elements by grouping them according to each digit’s position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), using a stable sorting technique (like Counting Sort) at each step.
Example
Input:
[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]
Steps:
  - Sort by units digit
  - Sort by tens digit
  - Sort by hundreds digit
Final Output:
[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]
Key Points :
🚫 No comparisons (<, >) used
✅ Uses Counting Sort internally
⏱ Time Complexity: O(d × (n + k))
   d = number of digits
   n = number of elements
   k = range of digits (0–9)
💾 Space Complexity: O(n + k)
✔ Works best for integers / fixed-length strings.
⚙️ Steps to Implement Radix Sort (LSD approach) :
   1️⃣ Find the maximum element in the array.
                     This helps determine how many digit positions need to be processed.
   2️⃣ Initialize digit place value as 1 (units place).
   3️⃣ Repeat for each digit place while (max / digit) > 0:
                     Apply Counting Sort based on the current digit.
                     Extract the digit using: (number / digit) % 10
   4️⃣ Inside Counting Sort (for each digit):
                     Create a count array of size 10 (digits 0–9).
                     Count the frequency of each digit.
                     Convert the count array into prefix sum (cumulative count).
                     Build the output array from right to left to maintain stability.
                     Copy the sorted output back to the original array.
   5️⃣ Move to the next digit by multiplying: 
                     digit = digit × 10
   6️⃣ Stop when all digit places of the maximum number are processed.
