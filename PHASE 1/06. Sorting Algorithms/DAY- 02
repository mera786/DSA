2. Insertion Sort
👉we assume array into parts one is sorted and another one unsorted so from unsorted part Takes one number at a time and inserts it in the correct place among the sorted ones.
Example:
List: 3, 1, 2
         Start with 3 (already sorted)
         Insert 1 before 3 → 1, 3
         Insert 2 between 1 and 3 → 1, 2, 3
✅ Final: 1, 2, 3
         🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation Explanation :
                                           Step 1: Start with the second element :
                                                             - We assume the first element of the array is already sorted.
                                                             - So, we start from index 1 (the second element).
                                           Step 2: Store the current element :
                                                             - Take the current element (say temp = arr[i]) from the unsorted part.
                                                             - This is the element we want to insert into the sorted part.
                                           Step 3: Compare and shift :
                                                             - Initialize a pointer j = i - 1 (the last index of the sorted part).
                                                             - While j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:
                                                                                      Shift the element arr[j] one position to the right (arr[j + 1] = arr[j]).
                                                                                      Decrease j by 1 to continue checking previous elements.
                                           Step 4: Insert the element :
                                                             - When the correct position is found (loop stops), insert the temp element at that position:  arr[j + 1] = temp.
                                           Step 5: Repeat :
                                                             - Move to the next element in the array (i++) and repeat steps until all elements are sorted.
